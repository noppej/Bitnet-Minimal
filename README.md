# Minimal repo to use `bitnet-cpp-rs` as a dependency in a Docker container.

- See https://github.com/eugenehp/bitnet-cpp-rs
- WIP, running in a Docker container on Mac M1 (simplifies installation of all the Python and other dependencies)


## Status
- Not working ... yet :-)
  - Use `cargo build -vvv` to see everything that happens from the build script ...
